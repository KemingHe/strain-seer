(College Hackathon Edition - Using Plasticine)

Begin with a 43 mm × 43 mm × 43 mm cube of plasticine. Choose any corner as your origin point for measurements.

1. Roll the cube along the x-axis to form a cylinder approximately 55 mm long and 13-14 mm in diameter.

2. From your origin point, measure and mark a point at x=6.5 mm, y=0 mm.

3. Draw a straight line from this point (6.5, 0) upward to position (6.5, 55) mm to serve as your reference line.

4. Using a flat tool (like a ruler or spatula), press down on the cylinder to flatten it by approximately 5 mm.

5. Roll the flattened cylinder around the reference line you drew, creating a curved section that will form one end of the connecting rod.

6. Continue forming the curved section until you create a circle with an outside diameter of approximately 50 mm.

7. Adjust the thickness of the circular section to about 13 mm by adding or removing material as needed.

8. Flip the entire model 180° along the y-axis to work on the opposite side.

9. Take the straight "ribbon" section extending from the circle and fold it toward the center of the circle.

10. Create another bend in this ribbon, directing it from the middle toward the outer edge of the circle.

11. Pinch together any gaps in the ribbon section below the circle to ensure a continuous surface.

12. Use a flat tool to press the entire model to a height of approximately 14 mm.

13. Adjust the width of the ribbon section (the connecting rod shaft) to 13-14 mm by gently pulling or pressing the sides.

14. Flatten and shape the circular ends to create the characteristic connecting rod end caps.

15. Use a pencil or similar tool to create a hole in the center of each circular end.

16. Pinch the sides of the larger circular end (the 50 mm one) to create small hammer-like extrusions where mounting screws would go on a real connecting rod.

17. Verify all dimensions match the specifications before finalizing your model.
