# Benchmarking Get Response Stream Calls

KemingHe: I want to benchmark time from user request (calling get agent response stream) to receiving the first bit/byte of data from the stream. how can I do this in python, please recommend best libs or use native libs per best practice

GitHub Copilot: I'll recommend using Python's built-in `time` module for simple benchmarking, wrapped in a decorator pattern. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
from typing import Iterator
from time import perf_counter
from functools import wraps
import logging

# Add these imports at the top with other imports
...existing code...

def measure_time_to_first_yield(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = perf_counter()
        iterator = func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        try:
            # Get first item
            first_item = next(iterator)
            end_time = perf_counter()
            latency = end_time - start_time
            logging.info(f"Time to first yield: {latency:.4f} seconds")
            
            # Yield first item and continue with rest of iterator
            yield first_item
            yield from iterator
            
        except StopIteration:
            end_time = perf_counter()
            latency = end_time - start_time
            logging.info(f"Empty iterator. Time taken: {latency:.4f} seconds")
            return
            
    return wrapper

# Modify the existing function by adding the decorator
@measure_time_to_first_yield
def get_agent_response_stream(
    user_query: str,
    chat_history: str,
) -> Iterator[str]:
    """
    Stream responses from the agent using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).
    """
    return final_chain.stream(
        {
            "input": user_query, 
            "chat_history": chat_history
        }
    )
```

This solution:

1. Uses `perf_counter()` which is the most precise time measurement tool in Python
2. Measures specifically time-to-first-byte (TTFB)
3. Preserves the original iterator functionality
4. Logs the timing information

If you want to collect these metrics more systematically, you might want to add a metrics collection system. Here's an enhanced version using Python's built-in `contextlib`:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional

@dataclass
class StreamMetrics:
    ttfb: float
    total_time: Optional[float] = None
    bytes_streamed: Optional[int] = 0

class StreamPerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = []
    
    @contextmanager
    def measure(self):
        start_time = perf_counter()
        metrics = StreamMetrics(ttfb=0)
        
        try:
            yield metrics
        finally:
            metrics.total_time = perf_counter() - start_time
            self.metrics.append(metrics)

# Usage example:
monitor = StreamPerformanceMonitor()

def get_agent_response_stream(
    user_query: str,
    chat_history: str,
) -> Iterator[str]:
    """
    Stream responses from the agent using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).
    """
    with monitor.measure() as metrics:
        stream = final_chain.stream(
            {
                "input": user_query, 
                "chat_history": chat_history
            }
        )
        
        # Get first item
        for chunk in stream:
            if metrics.ttfb == 0:
                metrics.ttfb = perf_counter() - start_time
            metrics.bytes_streamed = (metrics.bytes_streamed or 0) + len(chunk)
            yield chunk
```

This more comprehensive solution allows you to:

1. Track time-to-first-byte
2. Track total streaming time
3. Track total bytes streamed
4. Collect metrics over multiple requests
5. Access metrics later for analysis

You can access the metrics after streaming is complete:

```python
print(f"Last request TTFB: {monitor.metrics[-1].ttfb:.4f}s")
print(f"Average TTFB: {sum(m.ttfb for m in monitor.metrics)/len(monitor.metrics):.4f}s")
```

Choose the simpler first version if you just need basic TTFB monitoring, or the second version if you need more comprehensive metrics collection.
