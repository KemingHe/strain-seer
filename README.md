## üéØ Applications

Strain Seer is particularly useful for:

- **Material Science & Engineering**: Study polymer deformation, composite materials, and structural components
- **Biomechanics**: Analyze soft tissue mechanics and biological material behavior
- **Manufacturing**: Monitor material fatigue, quality control, and process optimization
- **Research & Development**: Develop custom strain formulations and multi-scale analysis methods

For a detailed understanding of 2D strain analysis and how Strain Seer implements it, check out our [Understanding 2D Strain](docs/understanding-2d-strain.md) guide, which includes point labeling conventions, strain tensor explanations with visual examples, and step-by-step calculation processes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Published Docker Image (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull and run the latest version
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name strain-seer ghcr.io/keminghe/strain-seer:latest

# Or pull a specific version
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name strain-seer ghcr.io/keminghe/strain-seer:v1.0.0
```

For detailed Docker setup and configuration, see our [Docker Design](docs/docker-design.md) documentation, which covers multi-stage builds, dependency management, security considerations, and container lifecycle management.

### Option 2: Building Docker Image Locally

```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t strain-seer .
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name strain-seer strain-seer
```

### Option 3: Local Installation (Advanced)

```bash
# Install pyenv (recommended for Python version management)
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

# Install Python 3.12.5 using pyenv
pyenv install 3.12.5
pyenv global 3.12.5

# Install Poetry if not already installed
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/KemingHe/strain-seer.git
cd strain-seer

# Create and activate virtual environment
poetry env use python3.12.5
poetry env activate
eval "$(poetry env activate)"

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## üìö Documentation

Our documentation is structured to help you understand, use, and extend Strain Seer:

- [Understanding 2D Strain](docs/understanding-2d-strain.md): A comprehensive guide to strain analysis fundamentals with clear labeling conventions, visual examples, and numerical calculation walkthroughs
- [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md): Detailed documentation for extending and customizing Strain Seer's core functionality, including core components, customization guides, and dependency management
- [Testing Strategy](tests/README.md): Our approach to testing, focusing on core strain analysis algorithms and data processing while maintaining a pragmatic balance with UI testing
- [Version Management](docs/version-management.md): Guidelines for semantic versioning, version bumping process, conventional commit messages, and best practices for release management
- [Docker Design](docs/docker-design.md): Detailed information about container deployment, multi-stage builds, security considerations, and container lifecycle management

The project also includes automated CI/CD workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory:

- [**Unit Tests**](.github/workflows/unit-test.yaml): Ensures code quality with pytest and coverage reporting
- [**Build Tests**](.github/workflows/built-test.yaml): Validates Docker builds across multiple platforms (AMD64, ARM64)
- [**Docker Publish**](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yaml): Automatically publishes versioned images to GitHub Container Registry when releases are created
